   - Add validation to ensure Assets = Liabilities + Equity

4. **Build Advanced Debt Calculation Engine**
   - Implement monthly debt schedules
   - Add interest and repayment calculations
   - Create debt amortization tables

5. **Develop Multi-Year Projection Engine**
   - Build year-by-year projection calculations
   - Implement compound growth logic
   - Add seasonality application

6. **Enhance Calculation Service**
   - Create comprehensive calculation engine
   - Implement all Streamlit calculation logic
   - Add validation and error handling

### üìä **Priority Implementation Order:**

1. **High Priority**: Growth rate methodology alignment
2. **High Priority**: Working capital forward calculations
3. **Medium Priority**: Balance sheet validation
4. **Medium Priority**: Basic debt calculations
5. **Low Priority**: Advanced debt modeling

## 13. Conclusion

The React website has a solid foundation with comprehensive data entry forms, but needs significant enhancements to match the Streamlit app's calculation capabilities. The main gaps are in the calculation engine rather than data entry fields. With the identified improvements, the React website can achieve feature parity and potentially exceed the Streamlit app's capabilities.
